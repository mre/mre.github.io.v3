Good talks are both, fun and educational.
Here's a list of previous events where I spoke.
I try to make every talk and every workshop as unique as possible.
If you would like me to speak at your event, let's [get connected](mailto:matthias@endler.dev)!

month = "January"
year  = "2020"

slides = "https://speakerdeck.com/mre/einfuhrung-in-rust"
description = """
Rust is a modern programming language that combines performance and security. 
It is close to the system and offers powerful abstractions that are 
strongly reminiscent of dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python. 
Rust offers memory security without a garbage collector and makes 
low-level programming easier and safer. 
I gave an introductory lecture on Rust (in German) and 
presented some of the most beautiful features. 
We discussed possible use-cases for web assembly, cloud computing and more.

Rust is a great choice for embedded development! 
It combines high-level abstractions with low-level control, safety with performance. 
In this workshop, you will learn embedded development on a microcontroller, using Rust. 

We’ll teach the basics, talk about pitfalls, and provide an environment 
for experimentation. Experience with embedded development is not required, 
but basic Rust experience would be helpful. 
Every participant will be provided with a LPC845-BRK development board, 
free of charge and for them to keep.

Our world is controlled by software. 
As with everything that is created by humans, software is error-prone. 
Everyone got annoyed by bugs and UI/UX issues before, but what exactly does "broken" 
really mean and are there different kinds of brokenness? 
Let's explore the fun, enthralling, and quirky state of our (digital) world 
and see what we can do to make it better.

WebAssembly is neither "web" nor "assembly" - but 100% amazing. 
It is our one chance to build a fast, safe, and universal compilation target for all 
languages and all platforms.

Let me show you why this is cool and how to get started with 
WebAssembly in Go, C, and Rust.

We will also learn about up and coming features of WebAssembly (like WASI) 
that will make it even faster and more versatile.  
Let's change the way we write software forever!

description = """
If you work with Node.js or Python you might have heard of asynchronous programming a.k.a. async/await.
It lets you do something else while you wait on some work to be done in the background - like reading a file or sending some data over the network.
But what is it, really? And are there differences between the programming languages?
Let's go on a trip through async-land and discover callbacks, event loops, and state machines.
We will look at Node's, Python's, and Rust's async features and how they work under the hood.

slides = "https://speakerdeck.com/mre/what-is-rust-doing-behind-the-curtains"
description = """
Rust allows for a lot of syntactic sugar, that makes it a pleasure to write. It
is sometimes hard, however, to look behind the curtain and see what the compiler
is really doing with our code. "It is good to know what these conveniences are,
to avoid being mystified by what's going on under the hood... the less magical
thinking we have of the world, the better." (Tshepang Lekhonkhobe). In this
hands-on talk, we will go from code with a lot of syntactic sugar to extremely
verbose Rust code.

We will use a little tool called cargo-inspect, which was built for teaching
Rust internals. The goal is to make the compiler more approachable to mere
mortals.

One of the things developers use every day is a shell. It comes in many
flavors, like bash, fish or zsh. Depending on your background, writing
your own shell from scratch might either sound intimidating or
pointless. We like to believe that it can be a fun way to gain more
hands-on Rust experience. If you want to play with concepts like I/O,
error handling, and syscalls, we invite you to participate in this
workshop. Who knows, it could also be an opportunity to start your first
mid-size Rust project!

During a recent Python Hackathon in Düsseldorf, Matthias somehow managed
to sneak in some Rust code while writing a fast, safe Python module for
encoding and decoding JSON. It passes (most of) the Python test suite
for the JSON module and was unreasonably pleasant to write. Listen

hand and how Rust can help speed up even the most boring,
highly-optimized tasks like parsing file formats in the future.
