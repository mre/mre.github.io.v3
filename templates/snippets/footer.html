            <p>
                I'm a Backend Engineer running <i><a href="https://hello-rust.show/">Hello, Rust!</a></i>, a YouTube
                channel about the Rust
                programming language and <a href="https://analysis-tools.dev/">analysis-tools.dev</a>, an open platform for static analysis tools.
                On this blog, you'll mostly find articles about programming in
                <a href="/2017/yes/">Rust</a> and <a href="/2018/go-io-testing/">Golang</a> or developer tools like <a
                    href="/2017/makefiles/">make</a> and <a href="/2018/ten-years-of-vim/">Vim</a>.

            <p>
                Maintaining this blog and my projects is a lot of work. With
                your help I can spend more time writing and developing. The
                best way to support me is to <a
                href="https://github.com/sponsors/mre/">sponsor me on
                GitHub</a>.  GitHub will even match sponsorships until October
                2020!  Alternatively, I also have a <a
                href="https://www.patreon.com/hellorust">Patreon</a> account.
                Thank you! ❤️
